# programming-partners

This repo is part of the onboarding process for programming partners at Funkhaus.

If you are looking to work on building websites for Funkhaus, [please read about how to apply here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/How-to-apply-to-be-an-approved-programming-partner-at-Funkhaus--BCTysbg0jcXjtbd3yIP4l9giAQ-WgJDb1H5IAinQQ4ahTiCm).

## Build Setup

This project is an example of our `fuxt` boilerplate, and is setup like the beginnings of a real world project. At it's core, it's a Nuxt website (so `npm run dev` works), but for the partner programming application process you'll only need to run this as a [Storybook](https://storybook.nuxtjs.org/).

**First step:**
Duplicate and rename `.example.env` to `.env`.

```
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload Storybook at localhost:3003
$ npm run storybook
```
